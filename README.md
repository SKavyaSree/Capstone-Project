PSCS-138 Securing and increasing productivity of BYOD in classrooms at school

Problem Statement:- 
Many schools allows students to bring their own devices (computer, handhelds or smartphones) to school to help with their 
learning. Most of the time now teachers encourage students to access online content as content becoming richer with videos 
and interactivity. Lots of school might even conduct exams on these devices. Now this increases  necessity for teachers to have 
better control on learning and they would like ability to control/filter website access of student during class as desired  per the 
curriculum. What we want: A web portal each school can have to give ability to teachers to block/filter websites based on 
student's names and or classes. You should be able collect student device and username information via wireless access 
points and apply some kind of filtering using firewalls.
Technology Bucket: (Software - Web Development,Networking, Security, Firewall, Next Gen Firewalls).
